# DVD Screensaver

This is a simple DVD Screensaver I wrote in roughly 4 hours in Java. It requires you to drop the file ``dvd.png`` into ``%appdata%\dvd.png``. 


## Controls

Use the scrollwheel to change the speed of the DVD icon. A separate window is launched whenever you load the program to give you statistics about it.
